## Ensuring FAIR-Compliant Molecular Analysis Software with MDAKits

>Scientific progress relies on the reproducibility and transparency of scientific findings. Scientific codes, for both data generation and analysis, are often not required to be released and are thus not held to these critical standards, making replication of previous results needlessly difficult. Researchers are rarely given incentives to overcome the substantial barriers to ensuring their software is properly tested and available to the community. The MDAnalysis (https://www.mdanalysis.org) Python library is used for the analysis of molecular simulation and structural data and is used by thousands of researchers across the world. To address these concerns regarding software based on MDAnalysis, the "MDAKits" framework was developed. The MDAKits framework addresses these barriers and encourages the development of FAIR-compliant MDAnalysis toolkits. MDAKits are standalone packages using MDAnalysis to solve scientific problems. The framework provides a template for producing an MDAKit base code, best practices documentation, and a kit validation registry which also provides an overview of the available kits using only metadata for the registered kits. Thus, MDAKits facilitate sharing and publicizing researchers' code while they still maintain full control of the codebase.
